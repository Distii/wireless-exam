    In a GNSS system, a meaconing attack is performed by rebroadcasting (towards the victim receiver device) after some time delay previously captured legitimate satellite messages. Due to the design of GNSS systems, such kind of messages are going to affect the possibility of receiver terminals to reliably compute the position, velocity, and time coordinates. Receiver terminals indeed rely on the measured time difference between the message reception and the time of transmission by the satellite contained inside the message. Therefore, when old satellite messages are received, the time computation is inevitably going to be incorrect. PVT calculations are going to be less accurate, usually observing a lot of sudden jumps in the computed position.

    \textbf{Note}: rebroadcasting all captured satellite signals after a fixed time delay is likely not going to affect much the PVT calculations on target victims, as the fixed time delay is going to be compensated by the user clock bias variable, a variable of the PVT problem introduced to handle clock desynchronization between user devices and the satellite system. This behavior was observed during the hands-on lab on GNSS.

    Compared to other types of GNSS interference, like jamming, the goal of this attack is not to completely deny the GNSS service to the victim (affecting its capability of detecting satellite wireless signals), but to make the computed position unreliable. Another kind of attack could be performed against GNSS receivers: due to the lack of any kind of message encryption and/or sender authentication, an attacker is able to spoof fake satellite messages carefully crafted to target the final PVT computation on receiver terminals.

    Meaconing attacks could be detected:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item after PVT solution, by sudden jumps in computed positions
        \item at the physical layer, like for jamming and spoofing attacks, by different signal strength, noise, and SNR levels compared to the legitimate signals received by satellites.
    \end{itemize}

\end{parts}
\begin{solution}
    % Z2lvcmdpbw==, corrected
    This solution got 6/6 points.

    For interference detection, we can use the following methods:

    AGC Dynamics Observations: This method uses the automatic gain control (AGC) adaptation employed by the receiver. By observing the AGC's variation over time, we can identify high-power interferences over the GNSS band, which can be used to detect attacks like spoofing. When high-power interference signals are processed by the receiver, the AGC lowers the input gain on the RX chain, causing a sudden shift in the AGC graph. These sudden variations can be used to detect interference. The advantage of this method is that it can also be used for spoofing detection and only requires the enablement of AGC measurement for the RX chain.

    SNR Measurements: High variations in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) can be used to detect interference signals that affect the overall signal quality and are directly measured by the receiver. High spectral noise will degrade signal performance, causing a change in the SNR. This method is moderately accurate and fast.

    Abnormal Waveform Distribution in the Frequency Domain: Abnormal waveform distributions in the frequency domain can be used to detect interference. These distributions can be compared with the "normal" ones in standard operating conditions, providing a statistical model that can be used for detection. This method may require extra hardware or software, which could be a problem in low-power devices where area and power are constrained.

    Machine Learning Models: Other methods involve feeding receiver data into machine learning models that can be trained on normal (interference-free) scenarios. These models can later be used for detection. This method is generally precise (depending on the model used and the amount of training data) but will require more power and area for inference.

    % cmljY2FyZG9yb3Npbg==,
    This solution got 5.5/6 points. Good intuitive explanation but how PVT works is not explained in detail (linearizatin , LS , equations)

    The GNNS system is a broadcast one-way wireless system. It means that the sattelites sends continous signals to the earth without recievng back from the users. Satellites sends 2 important informations: it's positions and the time of the message's departure.
    The goal of the reciever is to compute its positions on the globe. This means that the device aim to know its x y z chordinates. Being a system, to knwo these 3 variables, in theory only 3 satellites' messages are required. The idea behind the formula is that is satellites allow the user to compute a sphere with the satellite as orign (where the radius is obtained as the different timing betwenn the start (in the message) and the reciving (the station time)). With 3 spheres, they intersects in only 1 point wich is the user position. In theory it works this way. But wee need to consider errors in the timing: even a little variationsn can lead to errors in the computations. The satellites have really precise atomic clocks (that can be resicronised from base stations) and we can say that they does not hafve a bias. Such hypotesys is not valid for the user equipment. In order to calculate the correst position, we need to take this measure in consideration. This quantity can be descripeb as a statistic quantity, so we can add this o the unkows: x,y,z,dt. Now it's required 4 satellites to compute the correct position.
    It's possibile to compute the position with more than 4 satellites using the least stuare solution.

}
\begin{solution}
    Comment: 5.5/6; 1 ok; 2 challenges not really discussed (2.75); 3 Interaction can be partially inferred from the discussion but not explicitly addressed (0.75)


    The three segments that composes a GNSS systems are: space segments, control segments and user segments. The space segments is composed by a constellation of satellites that keeps broadcasting information to the receiver to allow the computation of their PVT. The satellites will transmit a carrier (basic frequency of the signal used to modulate the spreading codes and the navigation data), spreading codes (enhance the robustness of the signals against interferences and allows signals to be discriminated by unique orthogonal codes) and navigation data that will help in the computations. The control segments are ground based segment that are placed all over the earth. Those segments allows to have timing synchnization of the clock of the satellites with the earth. Those segments are divided into: tracking station, master station and uploading station. The tracking station will register the orbital data of satellites and the master will compute calculation on those data extracting information to ensure accuracy of timing information. The uploading will send back data to satellites to update informations. The user segments are the receivers that will take the signals broadcasted from multiple satellites and compute their PVT based on those informations. In particular, the receiver will lock onto the carrier frequency and use the spreading codes to distinguish the signals different signals, from those will extract the transmission time and compares it with the reception time and compure the travelling time. The tracvelling time will be used to compute the pseudoranges that contains lack in synchronization due to errors and have to go in a trilateration proces to exract the three spacial coordinates and the time coordinates (clock bias) that will be used to adjust the measurements and allow the user to compute its position with a precise accuracy in time and space.
